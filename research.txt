- [x] Programming:
    - [x] Simple playback
        - [x] plays sound as touched
        - proximity, different distances play different sounds
    - [x] Trivia timer
        - play a sound or trivia; have to touch the correct shape in time
            - if we have a display, count down points and score based on how fast correct answer is picked
            - without display; just right or wrong with count down timer (audio indication)
            - or wifi shield to use app or website for display
    - Balance to the Force
        - neopixel for light vs dark side balance; playing a light side sound moves +1; playing a dark side sound -1
