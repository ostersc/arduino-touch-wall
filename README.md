# arduino-touch-wall
An arduino capacitive touch program supporting interactive sounds and trivia game for character-based walls

## Example Star Wars Wall
Built with the [Bare Conductive Touch Board](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/touch-board/) and  [Electric Paint](http://www.bareconductive.com/shop/electric-paint-50ml/).  I developed this code to create this Star Wars wall for my son, but it is generic and can be used for any "character wall" simply by changing the sounds on the SD card in the numerically-named folders; no code changes would be necessary.
